   <h3>About Me</h3>
   <p>My name is Bisrat Kassa Tegegne originally, I am from Ethiopia, currently I am living in Silver Spring Maryland with my wife and my daughter and expecting a new addition to our family.  I grow up in the urban area where I can get access to computers, and during that exposure with the computers, I became interested in how it is working and make me eager to start installing software applications and even maintaining hardware parts and troubleshooting applications which inspired me to know more about computer science courses.
