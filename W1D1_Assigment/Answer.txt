Quizzes. 

1.-Both have a step by step of instruction 
  -A program is a set of instructions in a computer understandable language to perform a certain task.
An algorithm is a set of steps to perform a certain task and it writen in human understandable language.


2. 
Both use to store some data and reserve locaton.
variables are used to store data or information and the value is changable.

Constants are immutable variables which value cannot be changed

3. The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode
4. yes there is an error in the code because y is a constant variable we can not channge the value of z
